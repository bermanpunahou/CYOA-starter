__FILE STRUCTURE:__
1. __html folder__: You will need to create this yourself. All of your HTML files (except index.html) should live here. The file called index.html MUST be your starting page and should live outside of any folder.
3. __css folder__: All of your CSS should live here. You may just use one CSS file (cyoa-css.html), but if you have multiple, make sure they all end up in this folder.
4. __imgs folder__: All of the images you use in this project should live in this folder.


__TODO:__
1. Follow the CYOA project directions in Canvas. Be sure to keep your files organized, and commit your changes after every class period.
