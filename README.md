__FILE STRUCTURE:__
1. __html folder__: All of your HTML files should live here. The file called index.html MUST be your starting page. 
3. __css folder__: All of your CSS should live here. You may just use one (cyoa-css.html), but if you have
   multiple, make sure they all end up in this folder.
4. __imgs folder__: All of the images you use in this project should live in this folder.

__TODO__
1. Follow the directions in the Canvas assignments to fill in your index.html and cyoa-style.css files.
2. As you add more files, and especially as you add images, take your file structure into consideration,
   and use folders to keep everything organized.
3. At the end of each class period, be sure to update Github with any changes to your files.
